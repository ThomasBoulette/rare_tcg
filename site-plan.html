      <h3>Magic</h3>
      <p>
        The third rarest card in magic the gathering is known as known as time walk. time walk is an interesting card in terms of rarity for a few reasons. it is one of the very few insanly rare cards that is not obtained by getting a promo card or something simular. it accutaly comes from opening an origional alpha pack from magic the gathering with it not showing up very often
        The second rarest card in magic the gathering is known as black lotus. this one is simular to time walk in the sense that it comes frmo the alpha pack but it is a lot rarer due to the fact that the odds of pulling it are a lot lower and as such is commenly seen in top 10s as the rarest but there is one card that is signifficantly rarer
        The rarest card in magic the gathering is 1996 world champion. this is a very special card as only one of this card exists. the card was givin out 27 years ago in 1996 during the magic the gathering world championship

      <h3>Pokemon</h3>
      <p>
        The third rarest card in Pokemon is known as known as the no-1 trainer. this card was givin out during the 1997 Pokemon world championships to whoever won first place. however what makes this not one of a kind is becuase of how the tournaments are structred with multiple divisions as well as this card being used for multiple yearly championships results in this not being one of a kind
        The second rarest card in Pokemon is known as no-2 trainer. this is a bit different as this was a much smaller competion and the competion only happening once ment that the amount in existance is less than number-1 trainer. this was givin out to players who made it in second place during the tournament. this one was chosen as collectors seem to value it more than the 3rd and 1st place counterparts
        The rarest card in Pokemon is Illustrator pikachu. this was a japanese exclusive promo card that was givin out as a reward for a contest. the contest was fans submiting art of pokemon and winners would have thier card art printed on cards and Illustrator pikachu.

      <h3>Yu-Gi-Oh</h3>
      <p>
        The third rarest card in Yu-Gi-Oh is the promo first edition of blue eyes white dragon. Now while normaly a blue eyes white dragon can go got a couple of cents this one is special. This is becuase of it being a limited first edition promo from the kiaba starter deck.
        The second rarest card in Yu-Gi-Oh is the summoned skull promo card. this was givin out by upper deck and was mainly used as a sample and prototype to the card game in its early stages. it an be easily identified by its glossy holographic patturn and the words sample being printed on the back
        The rarest card in Yu-Gi-Oh is tyler the great warrior. this card is for a few reasons. this card was made using the make a wish program. this resulted in there only being one version of this card in existance
